It was really challenging to build the frontend of the application, since I don't have any experience with React. Taking in mind that I had limited time, I managed to create only one component, ReportList which fetches Reports for hardcoded user_id and start_time.
If I would have more time, I would definitely invest more effort to do detailed research about React.

I guess that you only need to run nmp run start to start the server.
